# Relocation to Sweden
Here we list info for students and researchers who are considering to relocate to Sweden. We update it as we find out more. Our group can host students/researchers interested in AI for medicine/environmental science short-term and help apply for long-term funding. Lund University is part of Scholars at Risk and has a large and vibrant AI community (https://www.ai.lu.se/).
Our group uses AI mainly to study cell death, lysosomes, environmental toxins and COVID-19 but we are also involved in some other projects. More info about our research here: https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/sonja-aits


## residence rules
The immigration authorities info page with all rules about residence permits can be found here: https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/About-the-Migration-Agency/The-situation-in-Ukraine.html. In brief, the rules are that Ukrainians can stay in Sweden for 90 days without visa and can immediately get a temporary residence permit under the EU’s Temporary Protection Directive. Immediately upon application to the residence permit, you can get help with food and accommodation, if you have an urgent need for it. Once you have received your permit you will, in addition to food and housing, have the right to work, the right to seek basic care, the right to schooling for children, and certain financial support in Sweden.

Lund University and many other Swedish Universities are part of Scholars at Risk (https://www.scholarsatrisk.org/) which provides support for relocating researchers. The Lund university page about this is here: https://www.staff.lu.se/research-and-education/international-opportunities-and-partnerships/international-collaborations/scholars-risk and you apply for help here: https://www.scholarsatrisk.org/get-help/

There are also scholarships specifically set up: https://strategiska.se/en/ssf-supports-ukrainian-researchers-with-30-million-sek/

MISTRA will likely grant more funding for helping researchers to join MISTRA programs (info from Lennart Gisselsson at Lund University).



## undergraduate students
Applications to courses and programs at all Swedish universities, for national and international students, are normally handled via https://www.universityadmissions.se/intl/start. Recognition of prior studies is possible. It is still unclear whether the application fee (900 kr per person, not per application) and study fees can be waived but a number of scholarships are available to all international students. If anything is decided about Ukrainian students specifically information about it should become available at these web pages: https://www.uhr.se/en/start/ and https://www.government.se/

General info about the process of applying to Swedish universities and available scholarships can also be found on this official page: https://studyinsweden.se/
